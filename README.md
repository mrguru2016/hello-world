# hello-world
First time learner in code world

I've done a bit of idependent interactive studies back in 2002 just messing around with the basics
Now I believe im ready to put the interest to use not only for my own Web project but to take on other projects also.
I own a Macbook and a Chrombook that i work between learning and experienmenting- Im ready to develop!
My project as part of my business venture is developing features for our website, which today November 2015 is in beta stage via Wix.com
